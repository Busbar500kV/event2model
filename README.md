# event2model

Executable chapters turning detector events into models  
by යසස් පොන්වීර

## What this repository is

event2model is an executable knowledge base built on open Large Hadron Collider data.  
Each chapter starts from detector level events and incrementally constructs physical models through reproducible data pipelines, code, visualizations, and interpretation.

The central premise of this repository is simple but strict.  
Models are not assumed. They are constructed.  
Particles are not primitives. They emerge statistically.  
Physics is treated as a process of constrained inference from events, not as a catalogue of objects.

Every chapter is designed to be executable end to end.  
Running a chapter reproduces the analysis, regenerates results, and publishes the outcome back to the repository.

## How to read this repository

Each chapter follows the same structure:

- detector level data as input
- explicit reconstruction steps
- model level quantities derived from invariants or constraints
- visual evidence
- interpretive conclusions

The code is not auxiliary to the text.  
The code is the argument.

## Chapter index

### Chapter 1  
**Dimuon Invariant Mass**

This chapter demonstrates how particle like structures emerge only after aggregating many independent detector events. Individual collisions contain only muon tracks. Resonances such as J/ψ vs ϒ and Z appear exclusively as stable statistical structures in invariant mass space.

The chapter also establishes the role of mass as a global constraint linking energy and momentum, rather than as a substance or excitation level.

## Design principles

- event level data is primary
- reconstruction assumptions are explicit
- invariants are privileged over frame dependent quantities
- statistical emergence is treated as a physical fact, not a visualization artifact
- interpretation is allowed and encouraged, provided it is grounded in executable evidence

## What this repository is not

- It is not a tutorial series
- It is not a textbook restatement
- It is not a detector performance study
- It does not assume particles as fundamental objects

## Intended direction

Future chapters will progressively relax assumptions made in earlier ones.  
This includes removing particle level primitives, introducing conservation laws through absence rather than presence, and examining how geometry, symmetry, and entropy shape model formation.

event2model is intended to grow as a coherent sequence, not as a collection of unrelated analyses.

## Reproducibility

Each chapter can be executed with a single command from the repository root on a Unix based system with Python installed. All analysis steps, plots, and published results are generated by the code in this repository.

The repository treats execution as part of authorship.
